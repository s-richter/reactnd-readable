# Readable: A comment web app - Udacity Nanodegree - Project 2

This app allows the user to view and create posts, comment on their and others' posts, vote on posts and comments, and edit and delete posts and comments. Posts are grouped into fixed categories, and can be sorted by their number of votes and the timestamp.


##About

This is the second project for the Udacity React Nanodegree.
For this app to work, it has to communicate with a backend serger, where the posts and comments are stored.
TODO: details.


##Demo

Once the project is finished, there will be an online demo.
